# Reproducibility Documentation

## Overview

All computational analyses in this project maintain chain-of-custody style documentation to ensure reproducibility and meet forensic science standards. Each analysis pipeline generates reproducibility manifests alongside its outputs.

## TMM + voom Differential Expression

**Location**: `results/derived/<EXR-ID>/differential_expression/`

Each dataset's DE analysis includes:

### Core Output Files
- `de_<fluid>_vs_rest.tsv` – Per-fluid differential expression results (logFC, P-values, AUC)
- `de_all_fluids.tsv` – Combined results across all biofluids
- `tmm_cpm.tsv` / `tmm_log2cpm.tsv` – TMM-normalized expression matrices
- `summary.json` – High-level statistics (sample counts, significant miRNAs)

### Reproducibility Files
- **`reproducibility.json`** – Structured manifest containing:
  - Script metadata (name, path, MD5 hash, timestamp)
  - Dataset identifier
  - Complete R environment specification:
    - R version (4.5.0)
    - Platform (aarch64-apple-darwin24.4.0, macOS Sequoia 15.6.1)
    - Package versions (edgeR 4.6.3, limma 3.64.1, jsonlite 2.0.0)
  - Input data sources
  - Statistical methods used (TMM normalization, voom transformation, limma eBayes, BH correction)
  - Output inventory

- **`sessionInfo.txt`** – Full R session details including:
  - Loaded namespaces and their versions
  - Locale and timezone settings
  - BLAS/LAPACK implementations
  - Attached packages and their load order

## Verification Protocol

To verify the integrity of any analysis:

1. **Check script hash**:
   ```bash
   md5 analysis/tmm_voom_models.R
   # Compare against reproducibility.json → script → md5_hash
   ```

2. **Verify R environment**:
   ```R
   # In R session:
   sessionInfo()
   # Compare against sessionInfo.txt
   ```

3. **Re-run analysis**:
   ```bash
   Rscript analysis/tmm_voom_models.R
   # Outputs should be identical if script hash matches
   ```

## Forensic Audit Trail

The reproducibility manifests serve multiple purposes:

1. **Method validation** – Documents exact statistical procedures for Daubert admissibility
2. **Error-rate calculation** – Enables retrospective identification of software versions affecting accuracy
3. **Independent review** – Allows defense experts to reproduce analyses exactly
4. **Version control** – Links results to specific script versions via MD5 hashes
5. **Environment isolation** – Captures platform-specific dependencies (BLAS, locale, etc.)

## Current Analysis Provenance

As of 2025-09-29, all TMM+voom analyses were executed with:
- **Script**: `analysis/tmm_voom_models.R` (MD5: `7c7d6805d4d3cd464dad4d543b1538c4`)
- **R version**: 4.5.0
- **Platform**: macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 (ARM64)
- **edgeR**: 4.6.3
- **limma**: 3.64.1
- **BLAS**: OpenBLAS 0.3.29

### Top Marker Selection Logic

The summary JSON includes a "top marker" for each biofluid contrast. This is selected using:

**Primary criterion**: Highest AUC among miRNAs with `logFC > 0` AND `adj.P.Val < 0.05`

**Fallback**: If no upregulated significant markers exist, select the miRNA with lowest `adj.P.Val` regardless of direction.

**Rationale**: Highlighting upregulated markers (enriched in target fluid vs. rest) provides clearer narrative for forensic discrimination. AUC maximization prioritizes classification performance over fold-change magnitude alone.

**Documentation**: This heuristic is recorded in:
- `summary.json` → `top_marker_selection_criteria`
- `reproducibility.json` → `methods.top_marker_selection`
- Each `top_marker` object → `selection_criteria` field

**Important**: Downstream QC and LODO validation use the full DE tables (`de_*.tsv`), not the summary "top marker" field. The selection logic affects narrative/reporting only.

## Forensic Marker Tiers and Recommendations

Based on LODO cross-validation and consensus marker analysis (Sep 29, 2025), biofluid-specific miRNA panels are classified into three tiers for forensic deployment:

### Tier 1: Court-Ready (Urine Panel)

**Status**: ✅ **Validated for forensic use**

**Marker Count**: 111 consensus markers (present in ≥2 cohorts with FDR<0.05, logFC>0)

**Performance**:
- LODO accuracy: 91-97% F1 across all conditions
- **Robust to quality variation**: 97% F1 on LLAUR outliers (TMM factors 0.25-63.3)
- Survives 560,000-fold library size range (14 to 7.9M counts)

**Top 5 Markers** (ranked by mean AUC):
1. hsa-miR-30c-2-3p (AUC: 0.981, logFC: 6.84)
2. hsa-miR-204-5p (AUC: 0.979, logFC: 8.34)
3. hsa-miR-30a-3p (AUC: 0.971, logFC: 5.89)
4. hsa-miR-200b-3p (AUC: 0.949, logFC: 7.27)
5. hsa-miR-204-3p (AUC: 0.945, logFC: 6.06)

**Forensic Justification**:
- Meets Daubert criteria: testable (LODO error rates documented), peer-reviewed methods (TMM/limma), known error rate (3-9% false negative rate), reproducible (manifests provided)
- Concordance analysis: 74% marker overlap between all-samples and inliers-only (preliminary finding, validated by LODO)
- **Court-ready testimony**: "Validated across quality ranges representative of crime scene evidence"

**Panel File**: `results/derived/cross_cohort/tier1_panel_urine.tsv` (top 20 markers, AUC 0.89-0.98)

### Tier 2: Quality-Controlled (Plasma/Serum Panels)

**Status**: ⚠️ **Requires protocol standardization**

**Marker Count**:
- Plasma: 76 consensus markers
- Serum: 39 consensus markers
- Combined panel: 115 markers total

**Performance (Clean Samples)**:
- TTUSC (Plasma vs Serum): 88-94% F1
- Plasma recall: 91-95%
- Serum recall: 89%

**Performance (Quality-Variable Samples - LLAUR)**:
- Plasma: 59% precision (over-calls, many false positives)
- Serum: **23% recall** (77% false negatives - critical failure)

**Top 5 Plasma Markers**:
1. hsa-miR-106b-3p
2. hsa-miR-144-3p
3. hsa-miR-25-3p
4. hsa-miR-4732-3p
5. hsa-miR-107

**Top 5 Serum Markers**:
1. hsa-miR-223-5p
2. hsa-miR-744-5p
3. hsa-miR-146a-5p
4. hsa-miR-191-5p
5. hsa-miR-199a-5p

**Forensic Limitations**:
- ❌ **Not validated for degraded samples**: Serum markers collapse under quality stress (23% recall on LLAUR)
- ❌ **Quality-sensitive**: Concordance analysis showed 2% marker overlap across quality levels
- ⚠️ **Daubert challenge risk**: Defense can argue test only works on pristine lab samples

**Recommended Use Cases**:
- ✅ Controlled sample collection (hospital/lab settings)
- ✅ Fresh samples with standardized protocols
- ❌ Crime scene evidence (degraded/aged samples)
- ❌ Unknown provenance samples

**Court Testimony Requirement**:
If using Tier 2 markers in testimony, **must include caveat**: "This panel was validated on protocol-controlled samples. Performance on degraded or aged samples may be reduced. Serum classification accuracy drops from 89% to 23% under quality stress."

**Panel File**: `results/derived/cross_cohort/tier2_panel_plasma_serum.tsv` (top 30 markers, AUC 0.81-0.95)

### Tier 3: Insufficient Validation (Saliva Panel)

**Status**: ❌ **Not recommended for current use**

**Marker Count**: 215 upregulated markers identified in KJENS (only cohort with saliva, n=45)

**LODO Performance**:
- Zero-shot detection: **0% recall** (complete failure)
- Issue: No saliva samples in LLAUR or TTUSC training sets

**Reason for Exclusion**:
- Single-cohort finding (not cross-validated)
- Insufficient sample size (n=45) for robust statistics
- Zero-shot generalization failed

**Path to Tier 1/2**:
1. Acquire ≥2 additional saliva cohorts (n≥100 per cohort)
2. Re-run DE analysis and LODO validation
3. Test robustness to quality variation (similar to LLAUR outlier analysis)
4. Reassess tier assignment after multi-cohort validation

### Protocol Recommendations for Forensic Deployment

**For Tier 1 (Urine) Markers**:
- ✅ No special handling required
- ✅ Validated for degraded samples
- ✅ Can cite LODO error rates (3-9%) in testimony
- ✅ Robust to protocol variation (tested on 196 LLAUR samples with 14 isolation methods)

**For Tier 2 (Plasma/Serum) Markers**:
- ⚠️ Establish SOP for sample collection and processing
- ⚠️ Document protocol deviations in case notes
- ⚠️ Include quality metrics (library size, TMM factor) in reports
- ⚠️ **Critical**: If sample shows signs of degradation (low library size <100K, TMM factor >5), flag result as "reduced reliability"
- ⚠️ Consider running Tier 1 (Urine) panel in parallel for comparison

**Quality Control Thresholds** (based on LLAUR analysis):
- **Green (Reliable)**: Library size >500K, TMM factor 0.4-5.0 → Use Tier 1 or Tier 2
- **Yellow (Caution)**: Library size 100K-500K, TMM factor 0.25-0.4 or 5-10 → Tier 1 only, report caveat for Tier 2
- **Red (Unreliable)**: Library size <100K, TMM factor <0.25 or >10 → Do not report Tier 2, Tier 1 with "quality-limited" flag
