# Go-to-Market and Funding Blueprint

This document distills the commercial and financing strategy for the microRNA forensic assay based on the founder brief (Aug 5, 2025).

## Value Proposition and Market Entry

- **Problem focus:** Current presumptive body-fluid tests are decades old, degrade quickly, and suffer high false-positive rates, especially in sexual-assault casework.
- **Solution positioning:** Tissue-specific microRNA signatures retain signal in degraded evidence, enabling definitive identification of blood, semen, saliva, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood, and other fluids well beyond the limits of protein assays.
- **Primary wedge:** Sexual-assault kit backlog (90k–400k untested kits in the U.S.); assay adoption accelerates case resolution and strengthens courtroom admissibility.
- **Go-to-market stance:** Complement or displace existing presumptive tests by delivering (1) robust identification on degraded samples, (2) ISO 17025-ready validation packages, and (3) turnkey software that preserves chain-of-custody audit trails.

## Target Customers and Stakeholders

- **State & local crime labs:** Demand low-complexity workflows, ISO 17025 validation packets, and compatibility with existing thermocyclers.
- **Federal laboratories (FBI, ATF, USACIL):** Early adopters who can set national practice; require multi-site data packages and inclusion in round-robin method development.
- **Prosecutors:** Need Daubert-proof error-rate tables, peer-reviewed publications, and expert-witness documentation.
- **Defense community (public defenders, innocence projects):** Require transparent methods, access to raw validation data, and affordable proficiency tests.
- **Kit OEMs and diagnostics vendors:** Potential partners for licensing the marker panel and securing reagent exclusivity through standards alignment.

## Pricing and TAM Signals

- **Forensic technology market:** $5.51B in 2023, projected $10.65B by 2030 (≈9.9% CAGR), with 67% of spend on consumables—favorable for recurring assay kits.
- **Backlog economics:** 710k cases >30 days old (~$440M unrealized billings at $620/case). Capturing 10% of degraded-evidence work yields ~$44M/year in the U.S.
- **Comparable willingness to pay:** Rapid DNA systems ($250k instruments; $100+ cartridges) and ABAcard p30 ($14/test) demonstrate agency appetite for premium consumables that cut turnaround time or boost admissibility.

## Funding Roadmap

1. **Seed pilot:** $57k to execute foundational validation—procure reference fluids, build datasets, and produce development-validation reports suitable for NIJ proposals.
2. **NIJ grants:** Leverage pilot data to pursue $500k+ National Institute of Justice awards (NIJ Forensic Science R&D) for multi-lab validation and field testing; annual NIJ allocation ≈$12–14M.
3. **Follow-on capital:** With NIJ-backed validation, position for strategic investment or acquisition (e.g., comparisons to QIAGEN-Verogen deal at 7.5× revenue) while expanding into international markets.
4. **Long-term vision:** Use forensic revenues (projected $10–40M annually) to bootstrap the original programmable RNA therapeutics platform.

## Execution Milestones

- **Scientific:** Standardize extraction/analysis protocols, publish peer-reviewed marker performance with >99% specificity, and demonstrate durability on degraded samples.
- **Regulatory/legal:** Generate Daubert-ready documentation—known error rates, inter-lab reproducibility, and ANSI/ASB-aligned SOPs.
- **Commercial:** Secure pilot deployments with backlogged crime labs, gather testimonial data, and negotiate licensing/partnering with major OEMs.
- **Operational:** Maintain meticulous chain-of-custody tracking within software tooling to satisfy courtroom scrutiny.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Reproducibility gap:** Mitigate with ISO 17025-aligned validation, inter-lab ring trials, and reference materials.
- **Capital intensity:** Offset via NIJ grants and staged product rollouts (e.g., start with high-value sexual-assault kits before expanding to full fluid panels).
- **Perception of RNA tech:** Address investor skepticism with near-term forensic revenues and transparent validation that bridges to therapeutics.

This blueprint should be updated as validation data accrues, funding milestones close, and customer feedback refines the go-to-market path.
